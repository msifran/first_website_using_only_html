# first website by me using html only 
 In this website used only html and make it interactive with the help of attach memes in photos, videos and attach references . on this i used so many tags like ( anchor , href image, video, audio , form , br , table and so many others ) .
 In form tag I used simple text wich helps me to get some information about user or i can ask so many question with it.
 Use of check box and radio button . 

As a beginner in web development, diving into HTML was both challenging and rewarding. From structuring the layout to adding content and styling elements, every step taught me valuable lessons and helped me understand the fundamentals of web development.

#  Note : 
My website may be simple, but it's a testament to my passion for learning and my commitment to mastering the basics before moving on to more complex technologies. I'm proud of what I've accomplished and eager to continue honing my skills.


It is just a starting of  my journey , and i am always intrested in solving real world problems if you have one share with me ,we can solved it together
